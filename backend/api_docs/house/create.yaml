  summary: Create house
  description: |
    House name must be globally unique.
    Upon successful creation the AWS IoT Core credentials will be generated and attached to the API response.
    Note that the credentials are not stored anywhere in the backend, therefore this is the only chance for client to retrieve the credentials.
